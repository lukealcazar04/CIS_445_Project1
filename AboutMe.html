        <pre style="font-size: 20px; color: white">
            Hello!
            I am Luke Alcazar a current Computer Science major with a focus in game design.
            I am currently studying at Bradley University in Peoria IL.
            Some basic facts about me, I am from a suburb of Chicago, I have enjoyed working with computers from a young age.
            I have quite a bit of experience in a lot of different computer related fields like
            CS, Computer Programming, Graphic Design, and Game Design.
            

            I am also very much into sports! I played multiple sports in High school and I ended up mostly doing gymnastics.
            I even ended up competing for my high school team at Sectionals,
            but sadly missed the qualification to compete in the state competition.
